<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 8 December 2025</p>

<p>SmartQR Studio (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides QR code scanning, generating, and editing features. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how SmartQR Studio handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>


<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1. Information You Provide</h3>
<p>SmartQR Studio does not require you to create an account. We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</p>

<h3>1.2. Automatically Collected Data</h3>
<p>To improve app performance and stability, we may collect anonymous data through third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase). This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>App usage information</li>
<li>Crash logs</li>
<li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No data is linked to your identity.</strong></p>

<h3>1.3. Camera Access</h3>
<p>The app requires camera permission solely for scanning QR and barcodes. <strong>Camera data is processed on-device only</strong> and is never stored, transmitted, or shared.</p>

<h3>1.4. Storage Access (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you choose to save generated QR codes or load a logo for customization, the app may request access to your device’s storage. This access is used only for:
<ul>
<li>Saving QR codes</li>
<li>Selecting images from your gallery</li>
</ul>
We do <strong>not</strong> collect or upload any media files.</p>


<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Information collected is used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve app performance</li>
<li>Fix crashes and bugs</li>
<li>Enhance user experience</li>
<li>Show non-personalized ads (if enabled)</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>SmartQR Studio may display ads via services like Google AdMob. These third-party providers may collect non-personalized identifiers for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad frequency control</li>
<li>Basic analytics</li>
<li>Fraud prevention</li>
</ul>

<p>AdMob may use a device’s advertising ID. Users can reset or disable this using their device settings.</p>


<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not sell, trade, or share</strong> your personal data.</p>
<p>We may share anonymous, aggregated information with analytics or advertising partners strictly for improving the app.</p>


<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>SmartQR Studio does not knowingly collect personal data from children under age 13. If you believe a child provided data to us, please contact us and we will delete it immediately.</p>


<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect information processed within the app. However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure.</p>


<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your region (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), you may have rights such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting deletion of data</li>
<li>Opting out of personalized ads</li>
<li>Requesting information about data usage</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we do not store personal data, most rights are automatically satisfied.</p>


<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain no personally identifiable information.  
Crash logs and analytics data are retained only by third-party providers for app improvement.</p>


<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted within the app or on our website.</p>
